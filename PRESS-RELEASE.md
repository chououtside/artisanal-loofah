There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Organize your job search! ##

## Summary ##
Hunt helps you track your progress through the job search! Stay on top of the job listings you're interested in, and move your application through the stages (application submitted, phone screen, interview) on the way to a dope job offer.

## Problem ##
The job hunt process can be messy and disorganized. It's hard to stay on top of dates and schedules, contact information, and what you have and haven't done so far.

## Solution ##
Hunt is an organization platform that helps you track all the information you need for the job search.

With Hunt, you can:

  - track job positions you want to research
  - schedule phone screens and interviews
  - remember the location of an on-site interview
  - track notes for each stage (i.e. an offer's benefits package)
  - compare positions at the same stage by which has the most pressing deadline, or sort your offers by highest salary

## How to Get Started ##
Just log in with LinkedIn and get started by adding a position at a company you're interested in to the Application Backlog. When you've submitted your application, just click on the item and change status to 'Accepted'. You can move on to the next stages the same way, as you get a phone screen or on-site interview.

If you want to get rid of an item that you're no longer interested in or don't want to track, just click the red 'X'.
